# Django-Tutorial
End result of the Django Getting Started Tutorial. Works with Python 3.

## Source

This source code is the result of the [Django Project Getting Started Tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/intro/tutorial01/) that teaches how to make a basic polls app.

## Functionality

This server facilitates the ability for an admin to create polling questions with possible responses, modify created questions, see responses and add more admin users. By visiting the corresponding site, users can vote on questiosn and see reponses already submitted.

## Room for Improvement

As it currently stands, this server isn't ideal. It has **TONS** of room for improvement:

* Bar graph polling results
* CSS styled front end
* Randomised question URLs
* and much more!
